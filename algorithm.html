            <h2>Our project's goal</h2>
              <p>Our project wants to answer this problem: How much joy was offered by any of the teams to their fans during the football season during a specific period? (How much joy did the team give to their fans during a home game during a specific period?) This is the problem we intend to solve.<p>
             </p>To make our enquiry more specific we put some ranges that put the teams, based on their score, into a certain category.</p>
             </p>For example, if the score is between the range 100 and 199, it will be included in category A.</p>
